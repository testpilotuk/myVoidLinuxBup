# myVoidLinuxBup
A backup of personal configs for my VoidLinux openbox setup and a set of instructions (See my Wiki - link is on the menu above) I created for building a fully functioning Openbox desktop from the VoidLinux base iso. It includes some customisation and my preferred keybinds.

To include but not restricted to:

.bashrc
.vimrc
.LESS_TERMCAP
.config/openbox/autostart rc.xml
.config/tint2/tint2rc
.config/picom/picom.conf
.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml
.config/starship.toml
