A backup of personal configs for my VoidLinux openbox setup.
This is a text version of my wiki as you will be faced with only the terminal after a base install and although there is no formatting in this file you will be able to read it in a terminal text editor or pager.

If  you want to clone my config files to skip editing configs then, once you have git installed, type the following and copy the files from myVoidLinuxBup directory to their intended directories.
git clone https://github.com/testpilotuk/myVoidLinuxBup.git

## Void Linux X86_64 Base Image Install Guide (for me)
Welcome to the my VoidLinux backup wiki! These are my personal notes to guide me through installing Void Linux Base image and create a customised version of an Openbox desktop with X11 display server and Pipewire for sound. If others are able to make use of it that's great too, I will attempt to make this wiki more legible over time. During the install you will use the following credentials

User 'root' and the password 'voidlinux'

## xbps package manager
sudo xbps-install -S   (syncs mirrors)
sudo xbps-install -Su  (updates installed software)
sudo xbps-query -Rs    (item to search for)
sudo xbps-install -S   (item to install)
sudo xbps-remove       (item-to-remove)

For a more in-depth description see: Void Linux XBPS Package Manager

Run the folowing command to start the install process:
$ void-installer

NOTE: Install the network version - not local

## Partitioning

use CFdisk for partioning.
use DOS (MBR) for BIOS system (gpt for efi)

NOTE: I use 3 Primary partions:
    boot vFAT32 = 1GB
    swap = 2x Ram
    / = rest of disk

reboot after install

## User (my user was not created after install)
useradd -m chris
passwd chris (then follow prompts)
usermod -a -G wheel,floppy,audio,video,cdrom,optical,kvm,xbuilder chris
mkdir Documents Downloads Music Pictures Public videos

## Setup mirrors including non-free repository (as a normal user with sudo)
sudo xbps-install -Su xbps
sudo xbps-install -S void-repo-nonfree
sudo mkdir -p /etc/xbps.d
sudo cp /usr/share/xbps.d/00-repository-main.conf /etc/xbps.d/
sudo cp /usr/share/xbps.d/10-repository-nonfree.conf /etc/xbps.d/

NOTE: Edit the config files to a repository near you using Void Mirrors as a guide.
keep /current at the end eg https://repo-de.voidlinux.org/current

sudo xbps-install -S (to sync mirrors)
sudo xbps-install -Su (check for updates)
sudo xbps-install -S xorg dbus elogind vim psmisc

I use xorg for my display server, dbus for inter-process comms, elogind tracks logged in users and I prefer to use vim rather than vi. I also install psmisc proc filesystem utilities for killall etc.

Symbolic links to auto run services:
sudo ln -s /etc/sv/dbus /var/service
sudo ln -s /etc/sv/elogind /var/service

Start services now:
sudo sv up dbus
sudo sv up elogind

Set keyboard layout if needed:
$ sudo setxkbmap -layout gb

## Window manager
sudo xbps-install openbox obconf obmenu-generator picom tint2 xterm
sudo xbps-install lightdm lightdm-gtk3-greeter alacritty lxappearance
sudo xbps-install nitrogen pipewire pipewire-pluse NetworkManager git curl wget
sudo xbps-install fontmanager firefox dmenu xdg-desktop-portal-gtk cups avahi nss-mdns
sudo xbps-install gnome-backgrounds mate-backgrounds nerd-fonts nerd-fonts-otf
sudo xbps-install system-config-printer Thunar leafpad

NOTE: Polkit will be installed as a dependency

sudo ln -s /etc/sv/cupsd /var/service
sudo ln -s /etc/sv/avahi-daemon /var/service
sudo sv up cupsd
sudo sv up avahi-daemon
system-config-printer

NOTE: If you are installing on a VM you may need to edit picom.conf and comment out the vsync entry. I usually like to create my own configs as I learn over time but in this case my picom.conf is copied directly from Derek Taylor's (DistroTube) gitlab dotfiles repo as I am still studying picom and it's options. For now I will be staying with DT's config as it is a very readable, short-and-to-the-point config file and is well commented.

### Edit lightdm.conf
sudo vim /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
/Seat
uncomment greeter-session and change to your greeter eg lightdm-gtk3-greeter
:wq

sudo ln -s /etc/sv/lightdm /var/service

Now login using your new graphical login manager

### Now install some favourites
sudo xbps-install btop exa starship tldr neofetch ImageMagick feh
sudo xbps-install gimp inkscape libreoffice

NOTE: My rc.xml config assigns ImageMagick to the print screen key for screen shots.

### Create and edit autostart

vim .config/openbox/autostart
Enter the following lines:
    xrandr --output Virtual-1 --mode 1920x1080 --rate 60
    tint2 &
    nitrogen --restore 

Set a new background using nitrogen by clicking preferences and adding the directories for the backgrounds you installed.
Now logout and log back in to check everything is working as expected.

## Pipewire set up
For a complete tutorial on the initial setup of Pipewire read Yurifuko's Wiki
Edit .config/openbox/autostart and add pipewire & to the file like this:

xrandr --output Virtual-1 --mode 1920x1080 --rate 60 &
picom --config ~/.config/picom/picom.conf &
pipewire &
(sleep 2s && nitrogen --restore --set-scaled) &
tint2 & 

Exit and type:
loginctl reboot

## Some customisation

sudo xbps-install breeze gnome-themes-standard
sudo xbps-remove lxappearance-obconf - cures segmentation error if you have it
obmenu-generator -p - generates a menu based on installed apps

Edit the .config/obmenu-generator/config.pl and change geany to leafpad

Go to your right click menu > advanced settings > obmenu-generator > Menu Schema and change the menu default apps to ones you have installed

For some nice openbox themes:
git clone https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/openbox-theme-collections ~/.themes

For some nice tint2 themes:
git clone https://github.com/downthecrop/tint2-theme-collections.git ~/.config/tint2

obconf  ( openbox theme changer I chose Raven)
lxappearance  (gtk theme changer I chose Adwaita-dark)

Improve firefox font rendering by taking away bitmap fonts
sudo ln -s /usr/share/fontconfig/conf.avail/70-no-bitmaps.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d/

## Logout UI
For this I use Clearine see okitavera's github page
sudo xbps-install -S clearine

Copy /etc/clearine.conf to ~/.config/clearine.conf  
Edit the file and change the commands as we are using elogind:
restart = loginctl reboot
shutdown = loginctl poweroff

Or just copy my config over to ~/.config/

Also, it would be a good idea to read the Void Linux Power Management page.
